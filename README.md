# DDos-Detection-and-Mitigation-System
The system employs real-time packet inspection and a rule-based approach to identify potential DDoS attacks and block malicious IP addresses while allowing legitimate traffic to pass without disruption.
Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight and efficient system for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in small-scale network environments. Traditional security solutions often struggle with real-time detection and mitigation, especially in environments with limited resources. This system overcomes such limitations by providing real-time monitoring, detection, and mitigation of DDoS attacks while ensuring the uninterrupted flow of legitimate traffic.

The system leverages real-time packet inspection and a rule-based approach to detect anomalous traffic patterns, block malicious IP addresses dynamically, and simulate traffic patterns for testing. It is designed for small-scale environments and ensures that resources are optimized for effective attack mitigation.

Key Features
Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Continuously monitors incoming traffic and compares it against predefined thresholds to detect potential DDoS attacks.
Rule-Based Detection and Mitigation: Uses a set of customizable rules to detect attack patterns and dynamically block malicious IP addresses.
Simulated Traffic Generation: Includes a synthetic traffic generation module to simulate attack scenarios, allowing the system to be tested under controlled conditions.
Lightweight and Efficient: Optimized for small-scale environments with limited resources, making it a cost-effective solution for network protection.
Modular and Configurable: Allows users to define detection thresholds, rules for blocking malicious traffic, and the ability to fine-tune the system for specific environments.
Easy Integration: Can be integrated into existing network setups with minimal disruption, providing flexibility in deployment.
Dataset
The system uses synthetic traffic generated by the included traffic generation module. This traffic simulates real-world attack scenarios, including high traffic from specific IP addresses to replicate DDoS attacks. This synthetic dataset enables extensive testing and validation of the system under different conditions.
